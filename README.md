# Offline-Processing-Methods-for-Hydrothermal-Detection-Dataset
To label hydrothermal anomaly data from the hydrothermal detection dataset obtained by the "Qianlong-2" AUV, point anomaly data (temperature and turbidity) are labeled via a K-medoids clustering algorithm, while subsequence anomaly data (methane and oxidation-reduction potential) are labeled using an adaptive iterative algorithm.
# Data description
During the period from 2016 to 2020, the "Qianlong-2" AUV obtaining rich and high-quality hydrothermal detection dataset in the Southwest Indian Mid-Ocean Ridge, including Depth (m), Salinity (‰), Temperature (°C), Turbidity (FTU), Methane (nmol/L), ORP (mV). Moreover, the sampling frequency of all data is 1 Hz.
