# Offline-Processing-Methods-for-Hydrothermal-Detection-Dataset
To label hydrothermal anomaly data from the hydrothermal detection dataset obtained by the "Qianlong-2" AUV, point anomaly data (temperature and turbidity) are labeled via a K-medoids clustering algorithm, while subsequence anomaly data (methane and oxidation-reduction potential) are labeled using an adaptive iterative algorithm.
